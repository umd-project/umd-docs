## Viewing UMD Doc

### How do we access the app
{: .subtitle}
UMD Apps are available for multiple platforms. Download based on your device OS. [Downloads sections](./downloads.md)

### Is the app free
{: .subtitle}
The app is **free**. In addition, there is no login required to view or create umd files.

### How do we view files from the app
{: .subtitle}
There are a number of ways to achieve this.
1. By opening the file from your device or desktop using upload.
2. By typing the URL of the file if it is stored on an internet server. *There are restrictions. Please read the Developer section for more info*.
3. By adding the URL to the web app link using the url parameter.

Check out the [Examples section](./examples.md).

### Can we open UMD files from Google Drive
No. Files stored in Google Drive do not allow them to be accessed programmatically via URL. We will shortly be adding the feature that would require you to log into your Google Account to access files from Drive.

### Can we open UMD files from DropBox
Yes. If the UMD file is shared in DropBox, you can enter the share url in the open screen to download it and show its content.

### How do we create a UMD
{: .subtitle}
The UMD app lets a user view or create a UMD. Check (About Creating UMDs)(./creatingumd.md)
