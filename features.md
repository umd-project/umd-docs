## Features of the UMD Doc
 
* It is a **container** document (*like zip*) that holds the different elements.
* The individual elements can be either **links** or be **included** in the document.
* Like any other document it can be emailed or stored in a network drive or posted in a messenging platform.
* An UMD file can be **password** protected.
* An UMD file can be set to **read-only**.
* A free Viewer/ Editor tool is available to generate and / or view an UMD file.
* A UMD Viewer webcomponent is available to embed it in websites or webapps.
* It is a free and open-source project maintained by RmR.

## Supported Components
The UMD Doc can support one or more of the following components:

1. **Text**: simple formatted text can easily be added as part of a document. Instead of uploading such a text file, the UMD App provides an **inline** editor to compose it conveniently.

2. **Image**: Pictures in the form of png, jpg and gif can be added. The desired image file can be uploaded to be part of the umd or a link may be provided to access it.

3. **Audio**: In a similar manner, audio files can be added to the document either as an upload or as a link.

4. **Video**: The video component within UMD permits embedding of videos from streaming servers such as YouTube and Vimeo. The advantage of this being that the videos get instantly played as it downloads from these servers and does not inflate the size of the UMD. In addition, the UMD format **does permit** uploading of the videos to make it self-contained. A nature outcome of that being that the file size would increase.

5. **PDF**: Any PDF can just as easily be added to the UMD Doc as one another component type. The App would add its content to the flow making it a seamless experience.

6. **Markdown**: The Markdown format, once only used by geeks, is supported as a component type. The ease with which users can make simple formatted content lends itself as a quick and convenient way to add content. Many of the samples in the examples link have used markdown files as one of the components. Those who are not familiar may wish to check out: https://www.markdownguide.org/

7. **Form**: Form is a generic component that permits user-interaction within a UMD Document. An example of a form component is to *embed* a **Google Forms** Link or **Microsoft Forms** link in the UMD. When the receipient of such an UMD opens it and enters the form data, it will automatically be updated in the corresponding spreadsheet of the creator. This component greatly facilitates: surveys, polls, assessment, questionnaires etc.

Over time the UMD Project Team will be adding more components to enhance the versatility of this doc type.
